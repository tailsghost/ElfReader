// arion.cpp
//
// This example demonstrates how to use the ARIO library to inspect and list the
// contents of a UNIX archive (.ar) file. It provides a simple command-line tool
// that displays information about each member of the archive, including its name,
// size, file mode, and any associated symbols.
//
// Purpose:
//   - Showcase ARIOâ€™s API for reading and iterating over archive members.
//   - Provide a minimal example for archive inspection and symbol listing.
//
// Abilities:
//   - Loads and parses a specified archive file.
//   - Lists all members with their names, sizes, and file modes.
//   - Displays symbols associated with each member, if available.
//   - Command-line interface: Accepts the archive file name as an argument.
//
// This example serves as a reference for basic ARIO usage and as a foundation
// for building custom archive inspection tools.
